        ## Example of how to provide the indicators for some user request

        Request: """Best place to put solar farms"""

        Response: """
            {solar_farms_example}
        """

        ## Detailed explanation of the task

        Complete the task following the next steps.

        ### Step 1: Pick 2..6 indicators that will help to perform geospatial analysis requested by user

        The user's request is: """{user_query}""".
        Use the user's bio "{user_bio}" to personalize the analysis and add contextual insights that might enhance the analysis. Focus on the request """{user_query}""", do not shift the main focus away from it and leverage bio details only if applicable. 

        Rules for selecting indicators:

        1. Identify indicators that directly measure or are significantly impacted by the user's specific request, rather than those that are proxies or indirectly related.
        2. Start with most important indicators.
        3. Avoid using more than 6 layers in the analysis.
        4. When adding new indicator to the analysis, check if you've already chosen some layers that are similar or overlap in meaning. Identify and select the most suitable one that best represents the intended analysis, rather than including all similar layers.  Each chosen layer should add distinct and valuable insights to the analysis. For example, population density and proximity to populated areas are interchangable: they both measure population density in different ways, it's redundant to include both.
        6. Reevaluate the chosen indicators to ensure they align with """{user_query}""" request, rather than the consequences or secondary effects.
        5. Explain your picks in "comment" field. Provide brief explanations for each selected layer, directly linking it to the user's request.  

        ### Step 2: create a name for analysis

        The name can be the same as user's request if it's comprehensive enough.
        Alternatively, you may paraphrase user's request to be more descriptive and contextual if needed.
        Analysis name will be displayed on UI as a label for the analysis you're creating.

        ### Step 3: add sentiments to the indicators

        Sentiments can be either ["good", "bad"] or ["bad","good"].
        Sentiment refers to the qualitative evaluation of an indicator's value as good or bad for the specific analysis being performed. It tells whether higher or lower values of an indicator are desirable in the context of the user's query.

        #### Algorithm for choosing sentiment:

        1. If the indicator's higher value represents a positive or desirable condition:
            - choose "sentiment": ["bad", "good"]
            - meaning: Higher indicator values are beneficial or preferred; lower values are less desirable. This sentiment is set when higher values contribute positively to the analysis outcome.
        2. If the indicator's higher value represents a negative or undesirable condition:
            - choose "sentiment": ["good", "bad"]
            - meaning: Lower indicator values are beneficial or preferred; higher values are less desirable. This sentiment is set when lower values contribute positively to the analysis outcome.

        Example 1: you've selected "Population (ppl/kmÂ²)" as one of axes for analysis. Is high population density is better than low for current analysis? set ["bad","good"]. With this sentiment, areas with higher population will get lower score than areas with low population.
        Example 2: you've selected "Proximity to X". Proximity is usually measured in m or km, it's literally distance. Higher values represent greater distance, lower values are smaller distance. So if closer distance (lower proximity values) is more beneficial, sentiment should be ["good","bad"]. 

        Explain sentiment choice in "sentiment_hint" field: why the particular option is selected, how it follows the Algorithm for choosing sentiment.

        ### Step 4: create a json containing indicators selected for analysis
